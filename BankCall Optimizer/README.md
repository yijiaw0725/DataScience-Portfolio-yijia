This project is based on the bank telemarketing data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8
The dataset contains historical records of direct marketing campaigns conducted by a bank. Each record describes a customer's demographic attributes, financial status, and past interaction history with the bank's marketing team.

The target variable y is binary:

  y = 1 -> the customer subscribed to the term deposit product after the marketing contact.
  y = 0 -> the customer did not subscribe.

Our goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of a customer subscribing, allowing the bank to better target marketing efforts and optimize resources.
